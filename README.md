Overview

Simple Log Service is a production-ready, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solution for centralized log management. Built entirely with Terraform, it provides secure log ingestion and retrieval capabilities with enterprise-grade security features.

Key Capabilities:
• ✅ Serverless architecture (AWS Lambda + DynamoDB)
• ✅ IAM-authenticated API Gateway endpoints
• ✅ KMS encryption at rest and in transit
• ✅ Point-in-time recovery and deletion protection
• ✅ CloudWatch monitoring and alerting
• ✅ Comprehensive testing suite
• ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

Architecture

High-Level Architecture

Components

API Gateway
• REST API with IAM authorization
• Two endpoints: POST /logs (ingest), GET /logs/recent (read)
• CloudWatch logging enabled

Lambda Functions
• Ingest Lambda: Validates and stores log entries
• Read Recent Lambda: Retrieves logs with filtering

DynamoDB Table
• Table: simple-log-service-logs-prod
• Partition Key: service_name (String)
• Sort Key: timestamp (String)
• KMS encryption with customer-managed key
• Point-in-time recovery enabled
• Deletion protection enabled

IAM Roles
• Ingest Role: Write-only access to DynamoDB
• Read Role: Read-only access to DynamoDB
• Full Access Role: Complete access for administration

Features

Security
• 🔒 KMS customer-managed encryption keys
• 🔒 IAM authentication with external IDs
• 🔒 Encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+)
• 🔒 Least privilege IAM policies
• 🔒 CloudWatch log encryption

Reliability
• ⚡ Point-in-time recovery (35 days)
• ⚡ Deletion protection
• ⚡ Automated backups
• ⚡ Multi-AZ deployment

Observability
• 📊 CloudWatch metrics and alarms
• 📊 Lambda execution logs
• 📊 API Gateway access logs
• 📊 DynamoDB performance metrics

Compliance
• ✓ AWS Config monitoring
• ✓ Encryption compliance checks
• ✓ SNS notifications for violations

Prerequisites

Required Tools
• Terraform: v1.0+ (Install)

API Documentation

Base URL

Authentication
All endpoints require AWS SigV4 authentication with IAM credentials.

Endpoints

POST /logs (Ingest)

Description: Ingest a new log entry

Request Body:

Response (201 Created):

Required IAM Role: simple-log-service-ingest-prod

GET /logs/recent (Read)

Description: Retrieve recent log entries

Query Parameters:
• service_name (optional): Filter by service
• limit (optional): Max results (default: 100)

Response (200 OK):

Required IAM Role: simple-log-service-read-prod

Security

Encryption

At Rest:
• DynamoDB encrypted with KMS customer-managed key
• CloudWatch logs encrypted
• Lambda environment variables encrypted

In Transit:
• TLS 1.2+ for all API calls
• AWS SigV4 request signing

IAM Roles

Ingest Role:
• dynamodb:PutItem on logs table
• External ID: simple-log-service-ingest-prod

Read Role:
• dynamodb:Scan, dynamodb:Query on logs table
• External ID: simple-log-service-read-prod

Full Access Role:
• Complete DynamoDB access
• Administrative operations

Best Practices

✅ Use temporary credentials via role assumption
✅ Rotate external IDs regularly
✅ Enable CloudTrail for audit logging
✅ Review IAM policies quarterly
✅ Enable MFA for administrative access

Monitoring

CloudWatch Alarms

Lambda Errors:
• Threshold: > 5 errors in 5 minutes
• Action: SNS notification

DynamoDB Throttling:
• Threshold: > 10 throttled requests
• Action: SNS notification

API Gateway 5xx Errors:
• Threshold: > 10 errors in 5 minutes
• Action: SNS notification

Metrics Dashboard

Access CloudWatch dashboard: simple-log-service-prod-dashboard

Key Metrics:
• Lambda invocations and duration
• DynamoDB read/write capacity
• API Gateway request count and latency
• Error rates and throttling

Cost Estimation

Monthly Cost Breakdown (Estimated)

| Service | Usage | Cost |
|---------|-------|------|
| Lambda | 1M invocations | $0.20 |
| DynamoDB | 1GB storage, 1M reads/writes | $1.50 |
| API Gateway | 1M requests | $3.50 |
| KMS | 1 key, 10K requests | $1.10 |
| CloudWatch | Logs + metrics | $2.00 |
| Total | | ~$8.30/month |

Note: Costs vary based on actual usage. See docs/COST_ESTIMATION.md for detailed analysis.

Troubleshooting

Common Issues

Issue: "Terraform state file not found"

Issue: "Failed to assume role"
• Verify external IDs match IAM trust policies
• Check sts:AssumeRole permission
• Confirm role ARNs are correct

Issue: "403 Forbidden" API errors
• Verify IAM role has execute-api:Invoke permission
• Check API Gateway authorization is AWS_IAM
• Confirm AWS SigV4 signing is correct

Issue: "No logs retrieved"
• Wait for DynamoDB eventual consistency (3-5 seconds)
• Check CloudWatch logs for Lambda errors
• Verify DynamoDB table has items
